•	The user is served with notifications at real time when any updates occur.

•	The password reset sends a link through nodemailer to user’s email

Additional features:

	This project was decided to be made fully responsive hence the design was made with 
  mobile first approach concept.
  The website is fully responsive at mobile resolutions as well, also there is a file upload feature 
  which was established using AWS SDK.
  It’s to demonstrate the application can take file uploads maximum six of 50mb. 
  
It is coded to accept only JSON file in the following format:
  
{

  listId : "LFUvfpEoi",

	userId: "FDCo8D3Ef",
  
	itemId: "kwFzxGCcS"
  
}

Assumptions:

1.	The user will use undo through keyboard command only for undoing the last actions.

2.	The user is familiar with social media applications such as Facebook, twitter etc since the design is inspired from those websites.

3.	The user will use file upload to just save his list details in JSON format in the server which will not be accessible later and stays for internal purposes.

4.	The user logs into the application with one instance at once or else the earlier version of the client session is timeout.

5.	The user can only add friends and not delete or remove them after adding.


Instructions:

The uri for front end is www.realtimetodolist.info

The uri for back end is api.realtimetodolist.info

The uri for documentation is apidoc.realtimetodolist.info

(only includes the routes of api counterpart since events are the same action and also due to lengthy documentation)

The secret key has to be stored in database hence it remains to the host admin to create a key value pair in the database as db.globalconfigs.insertOne({secretKey:”theSceretKeyYouLike”})

Refer documentations of Aws for credentials setup and also mongodb for database actions, socket.io documentation for events, nodemailer documentation for setting up with gmail.
